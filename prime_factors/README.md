# Prime Factor
This kata is from Uncle [Bob's blog](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.ThePrimeFactorsKata). Although quite short, this kata is fascinating in the way it shows how ‘if’ statements become ‘while’ statements as the number of test cases increase.  It’s also a wonderful example of how algorithms sometimes become simpler as they become more general.

I stumbled upon this little kata one evening when my son was in 7th grade.  He had just discovered that all numbers can be broken down into a product of primes and was interested in exploring this further.  So I wrote a little ruby program, test-first, and was stunned by how the algorithm evolved.

I have done this particular kata in Java 5.0.  This should give you a feel for the power and convenience of some of the new features.
